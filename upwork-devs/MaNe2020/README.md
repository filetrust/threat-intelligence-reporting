### Threat Intelligence Reports 
- this is the first raw structure of the report
- report is generated via python script, using pptx library (other examples from data vizualization team: https://github.com/k8-proxy/k8-data-visualization/blob/master/upwork-devs/Pappaterra-Lucia/modules/power_point.py)
- this library supports templates, so that final design can be improved by creating Slide Master
- data should be field in by extracting and parsing data available from rebuild engine

**Next steps:**
- extract data from Rebuild
- map slides data to extracted data
- redesign slides by creating Slide Master template
