### Project #6) Threat Intelligence Reports 
**Objective**:  is to create reports from XML files that is generated by Glaswall Rebuild Engine. 

- The report shoud be in Power point format
- Should be generated monthly
- We have proposed data that should be collected but also recommendation based on available data is encouraged
- Slides number can be changed and if there is more data, more slides can be created for the specified content
- Each slide could be nice to have diagram representation and also numbers
-A diagram that explains the workflow when determining the outcome for a file should be created and include in the report.  
it would be valuable to map the outcomes data on slide 2 to this framework

General Notes: You can see/create the XML files at https://file-drop.co.uk/
Here are a couple other examples https://github.com/filetrust/GW-Test-Files/tree/master/xml-reports
The GW Forensic Workbench also has a first POC of what this could look like
Add data from services like VirusTotal and Reversing Labs


Description of the slides:

Slide 1- Title- Overall summary and overview 

Slide 2 - Title - Emails and files processed

Active content identified shows the count of files with the named active content type
File outcomes are ;
Allowed - The original file is provided t the recipient
Disallowed - No file is provided to the recipient
Clean - The file was rebuilt but required no remediation or sanitization when sent to the recipient
Remediated - The file required structural fixes for conformance in regenration before being sent to the recipient
Santiized - The file required removal of active content (And possibly remediation) in regeneration before being sent to the recipient
Held - The file was not sent to the recipient due to being Malware 

For the detected active content, break down what was allowed in regenerated files (By policy) and what was not 

Slide 3 - Title - Outcomes by file type
Active content identified shows the count of files with the named active content type
File outcomes are ;
Allowed - The original file is provided t the recipient
Disallowed - No file is provided to the recipient
Clean - The file was rebuilt but required no remediation or sanitization when sent to the recipient
Remediated - The file required structural fixes for conformance in regenration before being sent to the recipient
Santiized - The file required removal of active content (And possibly remediation) in regeneration before being sent to the recipient
Held - The file was not sent to the recipient due to being Malware 

Slid 4 - Title - Modern and legacy Microsoft Office file types
Legacy file types (.DOC, .XLS, .PPT) represent higher risk as these are not pro-actively enhanced against new threats. 
These legacy file types were replaced by Microsoft on 2003

Slide 5 - Title - Unsupported file types count
These files types are not currently supported by the Glasswall engine
Glasswall still enforces a policy by file extension name or MIME type that results in an allow or disallow outcome for these files

Slide 6 - Title - Malware detection summary
Raw count of malware and cont of unique malware are shown
File outcomes show the policy decision made on these files - Were they brought into the organization
Each malicious file type is characterized and a summary of types is shown

Slide 7 - Title - Maliciious file details
The list shows key attributes of each malicious file
SHA256 hash can be used to look up the malicious file on service such as VirusTotal
